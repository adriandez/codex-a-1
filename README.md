# Codex A 1

A lightweight chat application built with Node.js, Express and Socket.IO. The server broadcasts real-time messages between all connected clients and logs each message with a timestamp and the sender's IP address to `chat.log`. The frontâ€‘end is served from the `public` directory and provides a simple browser interface for chatting.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the server

Start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```
The server listens on port `3000` by default. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable. Once running, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to join the chat.

Upon connection each client receives the current chat history along with a
unique session ID generated by the server. All previous messages are rendered
immediately so newcomers can catch up on the conversation.
